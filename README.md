# E-Byte

Electronic waste (e-waste) poses a significant environmental threat due to improper disposal, leading to pollution and health risks. Our project uses a machine learning model to classify and segregate e-waste, offering users recycling suggestions and locating nearby recycling centers. 

Leveraging advanced AI technology, our app not only classifies and estimates the value of e-waste (good, scrap and recyclable waste), it also offers convenient pickup scheduling, ensuring that recycling is as easy and engaging as possible. 

Additionally, the platform features educational videos on the importance of responsible e-waste disposal. By promoting awareness and providing practical solutions, we aim to users to make a positive impact on the environment and join the global effort to combat e-waste.
